## Rook's Journey

Rook's Journey is a turn-based multiplayer game where players take on the roles of rooks on a chessboard-like grid. The objective of the game is to navigate your rook to the designated final square on the grid before your opponent does. Players can only move their rooks along the row to the left of their starting position or downward from their starting position along the column. Each player's turn is limited by a timer, adding a strategic element to the game. The game ends when one player successfully reaches the final square, resulting in victory for that player. With its simple yet challenging gameplay, Rook's Journey offers an engaging experience for players of all ages. Are you ready to embark on the journey of the rook?
